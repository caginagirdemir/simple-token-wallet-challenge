## **Overview of the Contracts**

### 1. **YourContract.sol**
- **Purpose**: A simple wallet contract that allows users to deposit, withdraw, and check their ERC20 token balances.
- **Features**:
  - **Deposit**: Users can deposit any ERC20 tokens into the wallet.
  - **Withdraw**: Users can withdraw their tokens if they have sufficient balance.
  - **Balance Check**: Allows users to view their wallet balances for specific tokens.
  - **Owner Management**: The contract includes ownership management functionality.

---

### 2. **MonadToken.sol**
- **Purpose**: A standard ERC20 token contract for the token **"Monad Token"** (symbol: `MON`).
- **Features**:
  - Total supply of `1,000,000 MON` tokens minted to the deployer during deployment.
  - Standard ERC20 functionalities (transfer, approve, etc.).

---

## **Testing the Project**

```bash
yarn chain
yarn deploy
yarn start
```


This project uses **Foundry** for testing. The test suite verifies key functionalities like token deposit, balance checks, and token approval.

### **Test File: YourContract.t.sol**
Located in `test/YourContract.t.sol`.

#### Key Test Case: `testDeposit`
- **Purpose**: Tests the deposit functionality of the `YourContract`.
- **Steps**:
  1. Deploy `YourContract` and a mock ERC20 token (`MockERC20`).
  2. Transfer tokens to a test user (`user1`).
  3. Approve the wallet contract to spend tokens on behalf of the user.
  4. Deposit tokens into the wallet contract.
  5. Verify the userâ€™s token balance in the wallet.
